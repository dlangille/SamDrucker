I have posted about this in the past, but this morning I feel very motivated
to have a centralized list of what packages are installed on each host.

I know I can query the hosts, but having it centrally located means I can
'instantly' identify all the hosts which have foo-1.03 installed.

It was mentioned elsewhere that Ansible or Spacewalk can help here. I want
something completely independent.

You could get those tools to push the results to the web service.

This repo is the start of that work.
