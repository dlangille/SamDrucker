This directory contains SamDrucker clients in various languages.

A client needs to:

1. construct the JSON data
1. urlencode it
1. perform an http GET to the SamDrucker server

You can use whatever tools you want to create a client.

The scripts and dependencies are listed below:

`samdrucker-py.sh`

# https://github.com/jpmens/jo - for constructing JSON from a shell
# python - for urlencoding
